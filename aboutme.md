### Current Research 

I'm a graduate student in [Steven Robert's lab](http://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/) in the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle. I study TK 

how the environment impacts marine animals at the physiological and molecular systems level. I am particularly interested in how human-influenced environmental change is affecting species important to U.S. fisheries. I conduct experiments that simulate various ocean conditions and use omics approaches (e.g. epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) to measure animal response. To process these diverse datasets, I develop and implement bioinformatics pipelines for data normalization, statistical analyses, and biological pathway analyses. I use an [open access online lab notebook](https://afcoyle.github.io/notebook/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/afcoyle) to publicly share my analyses and support reproducibility.

My research addresses the overarching aim of identifying responses in molecular systems that could be predictive of species tolerance for environmental change. I aim for my research to contribute to informing policy in both aquaculture industries and conservation, and to contribute to education around how climate change may impact certain animals. Towards this, I collaborate with commercial, tribal, and governmental fisheries organizations, and actively participate in outreach media development.


### Background

Growing up in coastal Alaska, I have always been fascinated by the ocean and the various critters that live in it. That love took me to Bowdoin College, where I researched genetic links to thermal tolerance in the invasive European green crab. After graduation, I continued my crab investigations, working for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game on a variety of projects. Among others, I worked on Tanner crab research projects studying their reproduction and distribution, surveyed the threatened St. Matthew Island blue king crab population, and monitored Kodiak groundfish, shellfish, and salmon fisheries. I then joined the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, where I studied herring spawn events and ichthyoplankton distribution.
