### Current Research 

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate in [Steven Robert's lab](http://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/) in the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle. I study how the environment impacts marine animals at the physiological and molecular systems level. I am particularly interested in how human-influenced environmental change is affecting species important to U.S. fisheries. I conduct experiments that simulate various ocean conditions and use omics approaches (e.g. epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) to measure animal response. To process these diverse datasets, I develop and implement bioinformatics pipelines for data normalization, statistical analyses, and biological pathway analyses. I use an [open access online lab notebook](https://shellytrigg.github.io/notebook/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/shellytrigg) to publicly share my analyses and support reproducibility.

My research addresses the overarching aim of identifying responses in molecular systems that could be predictive of species tolerance for environmental change. I aim for my research to contribute to informing policy in both aquaculture industries and conservation, and to contribute to education around how climate change may impact certain animals. Towards this, I collaborate with commercial, tribal, and governmental fisheries organizations, and actively participate in outreach media development.

Growing up in coastal Alaska, Aidan has always been fascinated by the ocean and the various critters that live in it. That love took him to Bowdoin College, where he researched genetic links to thermal tolerance in the invasive European green crab. After graduation, he continued his crab investigations, working for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game on Tanner crab reproduction studies and monitoring the St. Matthew Island blue king crab population. He then joined the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, where he studied herring spawn events and ichthyoplankton distribution.

### Background

I am a West Coast transplant, originally from Boston, MA. After completing my B.S., I continued on as a research technician in Marc Vidal's lab at the Center for Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB), Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston where I became fascinated with big data and how network biology brings resolution to genotype-to-phenotype relationships. In 2011, I joined Joe Ecker's Genomic Analysis Lab at the Salk Institute in San Diego as a research assistant and was inspired to pursue a Ph.D. while developing a new high throughput assay for mapping protein interactions ([CrY2H-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4343)). I began the Biological Sciences Ph.D. program in 2013 where I continued in Joe Ecker's lab now focused on applying CrY2H-seq to understanding protein interactions that directly contribute to gene regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana.Towards the end of my program, I was driven to transition from basic research to applied research to help clarify some of the confusion circling around climate change impact. I became interested in how systems biology could be used to assess climate impact on marine animals, and completed a year-long NSF Graduate Research Internship at NOAA's Northwest Fishery Science Center using omics to investigate how physiology and genetics in marine invertebrates are affected by ocean acidification. I returned to San Diego in the summer of 2018 and completed my dissertation [High resolution molecular networks from novel 'omics' approaches elucidate survival strategies in organisms from land to sea](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0491n31k) and received my Ph.D. In the Fall of 2018, I began my Postdoctoral research in Steven Roberts' lab in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at University of Washington. Outside of research, I enjoy all outdoor activities from co-ed team sports to hiking, backpacking, camping, flyfishing, climbing, and snowboarding with friends, family, and my dog.
