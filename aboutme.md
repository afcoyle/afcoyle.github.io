### Current Research 

I'm a graduate student in [Steven Robert's lab](http://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/) in the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle. I study how Alaskan populations of Tanner crab (*Chionoecetes bairdii*) and their parasite *Hematodinium* are impacted by changing temperatures. I use an [open-access online lab notebook](https://afcoyle.github.io/notebook/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/afcoyle) to publicly share my analyses and support reproducibility.

### Background

Growing up in coastal Alaska, I have always been fascinated by the ocean and the various critters that live in it. That love took me to Bowdoin College, where I researched genetic links to thermal tolerance in the invasive European green crab. After graduation, I continued my crab investigations, working for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game on a variety of projects. Among others, I worked on Tanner crab research projects studying their reproduction and distribution, surveyed the threatened St. Matthew Island blue king crab population, and monitored Kodiak groundfish, shellfish, and salmon fisheries. I then joined the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, where I studied herring spawn events and ichthyoplankton distribution.
